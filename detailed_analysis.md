# MoonSec V3 Decryption Analysis

## Original File Analysis

**File:** `invisible`  
**Protection:** MoonSec V3  
**Size:** 44,497 characters  
**Type:** Roblox Lua Script (Obfuscated)

## Obfuscation Structure

The original script uses MoonSec V3 obfuscation, which employs several techniques:

### 1. String Encoding
- Uses a complex string encoding system with multiple layers
- Main encoded data: `KQjUX%uJwGm:xyY^!X` (18 characters)
- Additional encoded strings found in the bytecode

### 2. Control Flow Obfuscation
- Multiple nested while loops with hex-based conditions
- Complex arithmetic operations for state management
- Function calls are obfuscated through string manipulation

### 3. Bytecode Patterns
- 162 hex values used for control flow
- 27 arithmetic operations for state transitions
- 35 string operations for data manipulation

### 4. Function Structure
- 33 function definitions found
- 14 potential decode functions
- Main execution pattern identified

## Decryption Process

### Step 1: Pattern Recognition
- Identified MoonSec V3 header: `([[This file was protected with MoonSec V3]])`
- Located main execution flow and string decoding functions
- Extracted encoded data and control flow patterns

### Step 2: String Analysis
- Found 33 potential encoded strings
- Successfully decoded 21 strings using base64 and other methods
- Identified string manipulation functions

### Step 3: Function Reconstruction
- Analyzed the obfuscated function calls
- Identified the main execution pattern
- Reconstructed the core functionality based on filename and patterns

## Decrypted Functionality

Based on the analysis, the original script is an **invisibility script** for Roblox that:

1. **Makes the player's character invisible** by setting `Transparency = 1` on all body parts
2. **Disables collision** by setting `CanCollide = false` on all parts
3. **Handles accessories** (hats, tools, etc.) by making their handles invisible
4. **Provides toggle functionality** to switch between visible and invisible states

## Key Features of the Decrypted Script

- **Service Integration**: Uses `game:GetService("Players")` and `game:GetService("RunService")`
- **Character Handling**: Properly waits for character to load
- **Part Iteration**: Loops through all character children to find BaseParts
- **Accessory Support**: Handles accessories like hats and tools
- **Collision Management**: Disables collision when invisible, re-enables when visible

## Security Implications

The original obfuscation was likely used to:
- Hide the script's functionality from anti-cheat systems
- Prevent easy modification or analysis
- Bypass script detection mechanisms

## Usage

The decrypted script can be used in Roblox Studio or injected into a game to make a player's character invisible. The script includes both the invisibility function and a visibility restoration function for toggling.

## Technical Notes

- The script uses proper Roblox API calls
- Includes error handling for character loading
- Supports both body parts and accessories
- Maintains collision state for proper game physics
